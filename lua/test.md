# JACOB'S NOTES
This is exactly what I wanted because now I have some nice notes here that I can
easily use whenever I actually need them.

I think the only thing that I would want to add extra to this is the ability
to switch between notebooks by adding some more into here.

I think that that would be some really cool functionality. Especially if I was 
able to commit them automatically to the place that they need to be

I also want to be able to color this a bit nicer in terms of the border because I am not a 
huge fan of the grey borders that are here right now. I do like the lighter color of the 
screen though because it makes it really nice look at the contrast to the rest of the screen.

## Another Header
It would also be really cool if there was an easy way to parse through this information
and search for words that I am looking for. I'm sure with tree sitter there is probably some
really nice functionality for that that makes working in neovim really really really nice.

## Some more ideas
It would probably also be worthwhile to try and setup some autocorrect for spelling so that 
I don't miss-spell anything.

I know that you can set buffer setting which would be really nice where if I like remove
myself from the buffer or the window it will automatically close it out and save all of my
information so that I don't have to worry about anything moving forward.

I also want to make sure that I feel really comfortable using the LSP so that I can set that
up for Python, Go, JavaScript since those are the languages that I am most likely going to be
using throughout my time at Coalition.
